# Flutter App with Bloc, HTTP, SQLite, and Visibility Detector

This Flutter project demonstrates how to integrate several libraries including `flutter_bloc`, `bloc`, `equatable`, `http`, `sqflite`, and `visibility_detector` to manage state, perform network requests, store local data, and detect visibility of widgets.

## Libraries Used

- **flutter_bloc**: For managing state using the BLoC pattern.
- **bloc**: Core library for BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.
- **equatable**: For value comparison to make states and events easier to work with in the BLoC pattern.
- **http**: For making network requests.
- **sqflite**: For local storage using SQLite.
- **visibility_detector**: For detecting visibility changes of timer widget in the widget tree.
